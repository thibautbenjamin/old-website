A template for writing and hosting personal websites directly from github pages.

### Using the template
Create a new repository using the `use this template button`, the repository name should be `johndoe.github.io` (where johndoe is your own user name).
- Edit the `index.markdown` to write you hompage
- Edit the variables in `-config.yml` to add your name, email address, CV, picture and social media accounts
- Add pages in the `/pages` folder following the example of the `hello page`. The content can be written completely in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

### Aspect
You can see a dummy website based on this template [here](https://thibautbenjamin.github.io/site_template/)

### Credit
This code is heavily adapted from the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) jekyll theme. I modified some aspects to my own taste and designed a homepage that I found better suited for a personal website.
