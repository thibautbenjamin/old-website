title: About Me
---

I am a doctor in Computer Science from [LIX](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr), Ecole Polytechnique in the Cosynus team, under the supervision of [Samuel Mimram](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram//) and [Eric Finster](http://ericfinster.github.io/), and soon to be postdoctorate researcher in CEA LIST.

My PhD thesis is mostly centered on the theorem prover for higher categories [CaTT](https://thiben.github.io/catt/), and the theory behind it, relating to higher category theory and type theory.

### Research Interests
My main interests revolve around higher dimensional algebra in general and
everything related to the coherence problem that it spawns, from the
mathematical point of view and from the computer science point of view. This
ranges from homotopy theory and algebraic topology to type theory,
and I am interested about homotopy type theory as a connection between these
worlds. I work a lot with frameworks arising from categorical logic, and
I would like to explore further the link with rewriting theory and higher
dimensional versions of it.

### Teaching
During my PhD, I have supervised the practicals Java beginner’s class at Ecole
Polytechnique for three years, and for its follow-up class for two years. I have
also donce tutoring seesions in python and algorithmics for one year.
