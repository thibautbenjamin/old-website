I am an example website. 

### Writing
My content can be written in Markdown

### Purpose
I am meant to be used to create personal websites

### Using the template
Fork the project into your own project and fill it up:
- Edit the `index.markdown` to write you hompage
- Edit the variables in `-config.yml` to add your name, email address, CV, picture and social media accounts
- Add pages in the `/pages` folder following the example of the `hello page`
